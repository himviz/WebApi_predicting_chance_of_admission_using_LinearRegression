# WebApi_predicting_chance_of_admission_using_LinearRegression

I have created a WEB API using Flask in which we are predicting Chance of admission using GRE Score, SOP Score etc. and deploying it into GCP.
I have trained the model in Jupyter notebook and then converted the model into bytecode(Pickle File).
I have exposed the created model as a web API to be consumed by the client/client APIs, I have done it using the flask framework.
Finally, I have deployed this model in Google Cloud Platfrom.
